# is_eu4_loc_stolen_checker
A small python script that uses Google Custom Search to check if the localization from Europa Universalis 4 was stolen from the internet.. 

To use: get yourself an API key for Google Custom Search, and set up an Engine. You can opt in to either search through wikipedia, any other site or the entirety of internet.
Update the variables for the API key, Engine ID and EU4 localisation folder and run "python main.py"
